This is a (crude) Golang demo for the Insightly API. All it does at this point is list your leads.

To use:

- copy the default.settings.file to ~/.crm/settings.yml
- copy your Insightly API key from https://(your domain).insight.ly/users/usersettings, near the bottom of the page
- paste it over the the all-zeroes fake API key in ~/.crm/settings.yml. 
- go run crm.go
